# Security Policy

I attach importance to software security, but I am human and cannot be infallible.
Therefore, I am counting on you open source developers to keep me informed about real and possible security vulnerabilities.
Please follow the instructions below to contact me even if you are not sure if your question is about data security.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities, as GitHub issues are publicly accessible!!!**

Instead, contact us per mail: [covach.qn@gmail.com](mailto:covach.qn@gmail.com). We guarantee a response within two workdays and a security patch as fast as possible.

Thanks for your cooperation and your understanding.
